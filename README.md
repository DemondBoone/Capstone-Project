# Capstone-Project
This is my Capstone Project for PDX Code Guild 2023
my object is: Develop a program that uses the Shopify Admin API to suggest products to customers based on their Shopify profiles.
Build ecommerce that will suggest other popular things in a category. 
These FEATURE BLOCKS/ separately, some sort of Object to be collected.
Start off with the typical ecommerce. 
Plan, how to find suggestions.
-	As a user, I want to see personalized product recommendations on the home page of the e-commerce web application based on my purchase history and browsing behavior. 
-	As an e-commerce, I want to be able to interact with potential customers by responding to messages and comments on my profile, and offering promotions or discounts to encourage purchases. This will help me build a strong relationship with my customers and drive sales for my business.
-Home Page: Contains brief description of platform features, benefits, and how to get started

- User Login: Users can log in to their accounts, view their previous purchases, and receive personalized recommendations. If it is for an e-commerce profile the view and functionality would be different.. FOCUSING on the user

-Product Recommendation: Based on customer data and behavior, the application can provide personalized product recommendations, this is where my algorithm would take place. This will also include the option to select a recommended product and it will take you directly to the shoplifty catalog.
